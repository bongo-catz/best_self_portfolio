            Hey everyone! I'm Jonathan, a third year undergraduate at Johns
            Hopkins University studying BME and CS. I hope to one day become a
            physician, but in the meantime I would recommend watching
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_by_the_Sea_(film)"
              >Manchester By The Sea </a
            >. Yes, I know it's a sad movie. I also love to hike in my free
            time! Hope to one day visit Patapsco Valley State Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm originally from Cerritos, CA (small suburb near Los Angeles),
            and I live with my older sister and father. My mother works
            full-time in China, so I see her whenever she comes back!
          </p>
          <p>
            On campus, I'm pretty heavily involved in Charm City Science League
            (CCSL), which is a club that mentors Baltimore City Public Schools
            in Science Olympiad. Academic wise, I'm really interested in the
            intersection of healthcare and engineering, whether that be
            designing microfluidic chips for diagnosing STDs or validating a
            virtual drilling simulator for surgical training. To escape from
            work though, I sometimes play pickup Basketball at the Recreation.
            If you didn't know, my jump shot created water.

          <h2 class="major">What Is This?</h2>
          <h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This blog was written in response to an assignment "Best Self
            Portfolio" from the Leadership Theory course (660.320) taught at
            Johns Hopkins University. In this assignment, we were tasked to
            include three sections, as outlined below.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            The pre-work for this assignment included interviewing two
            individuals close to us about a moment they remembered us as our
            "best moment". I decided to interview my high school and middle
            school biology teacher Mrs. Song and my girlfriend Wenyu to see how
            I might have changed as a person before or after I entered
            University. I summarize the discussions in the section under
            "Interviews".
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Self-Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            We were asked to take two self-assessments (listed and linked below)
            and reflect on the results of the two assessments. We were also
            asked to reflect upon a leadership concept we have covered in class
            and provide examples of when we have demonstrated this concept. I
            decided to focus on Transformational Leadership as that was a very
            recently covered concept! I summarize this reflection in the section
            "Self-Reflection".

            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="major">Growth</h3>
          <p>
            To cap off this assignment, we were asked to identify an area of
            growth within ourselves, whether that be as leaders or as followers.
            And as a follow-up, to ensure we actually can implement this change,
            we were asked to identify a concrete way to grow and also how we
            envision our growth helping our teams. I summarize this process in
            the section under "Growth".
          </p>

          <h2 class="major">Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            I had the pleasure of interviewing two people about a time when I
            was at my best self. Wanting to see how I changed from high school
            to university, I decided to interview one person from before and
            another person from after I entered University.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Mrs. Song</h3>
          <span class="image main">

              <img src="images/song.jpg" alt="" />
              <figcaption>Our Team at Regionals</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </span>
          <p>
            <b>Name:</b> Mrs. Song <br />
            <b>Current Occupation:</b> Current High School Biology Teacher at
            Whitney High School <br />
            <b>Favorite Song:</b> "Can't Help Falling in Love" by Elvis Presley
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my time in high school, I knew Mrs. Song well, having
            first met her in 7th grade. Physically, I didn't change much over
            the years, but Mrs. Song never failed to notice the personal growth
            I underwent. From a shy yet studious student who consistently aced
            Kahoot quizzes, I matured into a sociable and people-oriented
            leader. In my sophomore year, I became involved in Mrs. Song's
            effort to establish a Science Olympiad program in our school. For
            three years, we worked tirelessly to build and hone our team.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my senior year, Mrs. Song and I were determined to see our team
            advance to the States Competition. Unfortunately, on the day of the
            Regionals Competition, everything seemed to go wrong. Our bus
            arrived late, and then we were stuck in traffic. We even missed out
            on competing in two events. Despite the setbacks, I maintained a
            positive attitude and encouraged my teammates to keep going. I
            reminded them how much we had practiced together and tried to lift
            their spirits by emphasizing the importance of having fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            After six grueling hours of competition, we finally made it to the
            awards ceremony. As they announced the placements of the teams, I
            watched anxiously, hoping for the best. Though as 6th through 3rd
            place were announced, I saw Mrs. Song shaking her head in
            disappointment. But I refused to give up hope and exclaimed “Hey,
            there are still 2 places left.” And then it happened - our team was
            declared the second-place winner!
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Song recounted this story to share that I was at my best when I
            utilized my optimism to help lift my teammates up, even when
            everything seemed to go wrong. When I turned to my team during the
            awards ceremony and said that there were still 2 places left, Mrs.
            Song felt it showed how much I believed in the people I cared for.
            While others were becoming discouraged again, I still maintained
            hope. A quote from Mrs. Song: "Jonathan, even I doubted our team's
            success, but you really showed the importance of never giving up and
            appreciating the journey."

            <b>Favorite Song:</b> “Save Your Tears” by The Weeknd
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to interview my now (and hopefully future) girlfriend
            Wenyu. I met her online during Zoom university in our first class
            BME Modeling & Design where we were on the same team. Let it be
            known here that she chased me 🙂, but jokes aside, Wenyu has really
            allowed me to experience college besides just hitting Brody on
            Friday nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last summer, I decided to be foolishly ambitious. I took on a great
            deal of responsibility. While interning remotely at a pharmaceutical
            company, I also volunteered at Johns Hopkins Hospital, studied for
            the MCAT, and made time for my girlfriend. Yep, quite a busy plate.
            Despite feeling overwhelmed at times, Wenyu reported noticing some
            of my best moments during this period. I successfully managed my
            time to prioritize my tasks effectively. I always communicated with
            my internship manager and was able to develop a fully working
            database even though I never once touched SQL (a database management
            software) or backend work. And through the chaos, I also made sure
            to have fun and take breaks. I visited Towson and Federal Hill park
            for the first time. Surprisingly, I even learned how to cook,
            although initially I scared Wenyu with my knife skills and failed to
            make instant ramen by accidentally throwing away the salt packet.
          </p>
          <p>
            And from the 3 month period, Wenyu decided I was at my best was when
            I made her a birthday meal. Even though her birthday was two-weeks
            before my MCAT exam and near the deadline for my internship project,
            I took the time to learn recipies for dishes from her family's
            province in China (Fujian). I knew she had been craving her mother's
            cooking all summer, so alothough I sure was not as well-versed as
            her mother, I wanted to repay Wenyu for her immense support. I made
            <a
              href="https://www.archanaskitchen.com/fujian-style-hot-dry-noodle-recipe"
              >Fujian fried noodles</a

              >oyster pancakes </a
            >, and while Wenyu said the fried noodles were a bit salty, she
            greatly appreciated how despite my busy schedule I still took time
            to go out of my comfort zone to make sure she was happy!

            So from talking to Mrs. Song and Wenyu, I see that regardless of
            before and after starting University, I still manage to perform best
            under pressure. This may be thanks to my (sometimes foolish)
            optimism. One of my favorite quotes I always tell friends is that
            "Diamonds are formed under pressure!", and I suppose this does ring
            true for me. During times of stress, I like to crack jokes and
            lighten the mood. It does not sit well with me to complain or flaunt
            how stressed I am, but rather try to reframe how I view issues. For
            example, even if it's 2 AM and I'm finishing up a project report,
            instead of honing in on how my back aches, I'd much rather focus on
            how rewarding it is to be learning and working hard.

            In this section I dive deeper into Transformational Leadership and
            also a few times I exhibited qualities of this leadership principle.
            I also reflected upon two personal assessments (
            <a
              href="http://www.blake-group.com/sites/default/files/assessments/Conflict_Management_Styles_Assessment.pdf"
              >Conflict Management Styles Assessment
            </a>
            and
            <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test"
              >16 Personalities Assessment </a
            >)
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Transformational Leadership</h3>
          <p>
            Transformational Leadership is a leadership style that is built upon
            four pillars: Idealized Influence, Inspirational Motivation,
            Intellectual Stimulation, and Individualized Consideration [1]. The
            first pillar of Transformational Leadership, Idealized Influence,
            refers to the leader's ability to act as a role model for their
            followers. This involves demonstrating high ethical standards,
            setting an example of excellence, and building trust with followers.
            The second pillar, Inspirational Motivation, involves inspiring and
            motivating followers to reach their full potential. Transformational
            leaders do this by communicating a compelling vision, setting
            challenging goals, and providing a sense of purpose and meaning to
            their work. The third pillar, Intellectual Stimulation, involves
            encouraging creativity and innovation within the organization.
            Transformational leaders challenge their followers to think
            critically, question assumptions, and seek out new solutions to
            problems. The fourth and final pillar of Transformational Leadership
            is Individualized Consideration. This involves showing empathy and
            concern for the needs and aspirations of individual followers.
            Transformational leaders invest in the personal and professional
            growth of their followers, providing support, mentorship, and
            development opportunities. By combining these four pillars,
            Transformational leaders can inspire and motivate their followers to
            achieve great things. They provide a clear vision and purpose, act
            as role models, foster creativity and innovation, and invest in the
            personal and professional growth of their followers. This approach
            can lead to positive change and success within the organization or
            group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Transformational Leadership is a leadership style that aims to
            inspire and motivate followers to achieve their full potential, both
            individually and as a team, in order to bring about positive change.
            It is a theory that focuses on the followers, their motivations, and
            their development, rather than just the leader's actions. The idea
            of Transformational Leadership was first introduced by James
            MacGregor Burns in 1978 and expanded upon by Bernard Bass in the
            1980s [2].
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key nuances of Transformational Leadership is that it
            takes time [2]. This style of leadership is not something that can
            be implemented overnigh. It requires a deep understanding of the
            needs, aspirations, and strengths of the people you are leading, as
            well as a willingness to invest the necessary time and effort to
            develop them. It involves building relationships with followers,
            gaining their trust, and working with them to set and achieve goals.
            Another important aspect of Transformational Leadership is that it
            can be used in conjunction with Transactional Leadership.
            Transactional Leadership is a more traditional style of leadership
            that focuses on the exchange of rewards and punishments for
            performance. While Transformational Leadership aims to inspire and
            motivate followers, Transactional Leadership aims to provide
            structure and ensure that tasks are completed efficiently. Combining
            these two styles can create a well-rounded leadership approach that
            addresses both the needs of the followers and the organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lastly, Transformational Leadership is about helping people to reach
            a new level based on their motivations, not necessarily the leader's
            motivations [2]. This involves understanding what drives each
            individual, what their goals are, and what obstacles they face. The
            leader's role is to provide guidance, support, and resources to help
            followers overcome these obstacles and achieve their goals. By doing
            so, Transformational leaders create a culture of growth and
            development, where everyone feels valued and supported.

          <h4 class="major">Experience #1: Young Engineers in Action</h4>
          <p>
            Space has always fascinated me. The vast unknown scares some, but
            for me, it is inspiring. I suppose you could guess Interstellar is
            my favorite movie of all time. Hence, when I was offered the
            opportunity to start a rocketry team in my local community, I was
            more than stoked. Being able to engineer a model rocket with 3D
            printing and electronics sounded too cool to be true. Now as the
            team was open to every student in the local community, my team was
            comprised of elementary schoolers to high schoolers. Everyone had
            different skill sets, knowledge, and interests, and so I looked to
            meet everyone where they were. For the elementary and middle school
            members, I held sessions outlining aerodynamic concepts such as drag
            and propulsion. For those interested in rapid prototyping, I
            organized CAD workshops. We even had different nationalities on the
            team, and sometimes I would have to use other languages to
            communicate my ideas better (Spanish and Chinese). Looking back, I
            applied the Individualized Consideration aspect of Transformational
            Leadership, as I provided individualized coaching, mentoring, and
            support to help my team members achieve their goals and develop
            their skills.

          <h4 class="major">Experience #2: Charm City Science League</h4>
          <p>
            Science Olympiad was a major part of my high school experience, so
            coming to university I decided to join Charm City Science League
            (CCSL), a group on campus looking to utilize Science Olympiad to
            motivate Baltimore students to be interested in STEM. Now serving on
            the Executive Board, I lead the initiative Build It, Study It
            (BISI), which is a day event where Baltimore middle school students
            come to Homewood and go through a science fair learning diverse
            science concepts! As the director, I believe I embodied
            Transformational Leadership. I demonstrated Idealized Influence by
            acting as a role model for the other 30+ volunteers and event
            planners. My passion for Science Olympiad and STEM education
            inspired the team to work towards the common goal of promoting
            interest in science among Baltimore students. I also showed
            Inspirational Motivation by communicating a compelling vision and
            purpose for the BISI to the entire leadership and organizing team.
            While others were worried about potentially being overly-ambitious,
            I emphasized the importance of exposing students to diverse science
            concepts, eventually motivating the team to organize 15 unique
            activities. Furthermore, I demonstrated Intellectual Stimulation by
            encouraging creativity and innovation within the BISI event. By
            promoting a wide range of science concepts and encouraging
            experimentation, I was able to foster a culture of innovation and
            learning among the participating students. I also provided the
            organizing team largely unrestrained guidelines to give them as much
            room possible to be creative about the events they wanted to host
            for the students.

          <p>
            Based on the conflict management style assessment, I am a
            <b>teddy bear (accommodating)</b> who values relationships with
            others over my own goals. There are 5 possible conflict management
            styles, each with a maximum score of 12. I scored in the ranges of
            4-6 for the other 4 styles and 10 for the accommodating style. So in
            other words, the accommodating style was pretty dominant. I believe
            this is relatively accurate as I do value my relationships with
            friends, mentors, and family and tend to avoid conflicts by just
            smoothing them over and going back to focus on other tasks. For
            example, sometimes I will fight with my girlfriend over doing the
            chores. Our guidelines are whoever does not cook has to wash the
            dishes, and she usually is the one that cooks as I am not a great
            cook. In addition, she is a clean freak and dislikes mess in the
            kitchen. I consider myself not to be messy, but sometimes I leave
            the dishes off until after I finish my work. Though when I have
            mountains of work that are due soon, this situation escalates as she
            rushes me to clean up the dishes. I feel like a knot in the center
            of the rope pulled in a game of tug of war. In the end, I give in
            and wash the dishes as she wishes while stressing about my homework.
            It can be hard at times, trying to keep everyone and myself happy.
            Most relationships should have some give and take, and I believe I
            can become more like an owl in the future. I should value not only
            my relationships but also my desires and goals. I want to to treat
            conflicts as a way to get closer to the other person, realize our
            differences, and ease the tension by compromising on both sides. I
            need to work on my avoidance of conflicts and be brave enough to
            start the conversion for a resolution.

            </figure>
          </span>
          <p>
            Based on my 16 personality assessment, my personality type is an
            <b>Assertive Protoganist (ENFJ-A)</b>. Though when analyzing my
            actual percentages of Extraversion v.s. Intraversion, Intuitive v.s.
            Observant, Thinking v.s. Feeling, and Judging v.s. Prospecting I
            found it quite interesting that neither actually had a significant
            majority. They were all in the range of 52% - 56%. So when the
            assessment reports that I am Extraverted, I have to think to myself,
            "Am I really Extraverted?". I showed my lab mentor the results and
            even she was surprised to find I was "Extraverted".
          </p>
          <p>
            But the percentages do internally make sense. For example, I may not
            be 100% Extraverted, but I sure am more Extraverted than I am
            Intraverted. If there's something I find issues with, I'm more than
            happy to stand up for what I think. I believe this also plays into
            my Assertive rating of 64%. If someone is rude towards me or the
            people I care about, I'm not afraid to speak up. For example, if
            someone cuts me or my friends in a long line, I'm often the one
            calling that person out, even if my friends shrug it off. But still,
            I'm not Extraverted to the point where I seek social connections
            every hour of the day!
          </p>
          <p>
            For my 56% Intuitive rating, I find that I do often lean towards the
            more visionary side of planning. Back to my CCSL example with
            planning BISI, I laid out the goal of the event to offer diverse
            events for students to experience and learn from! And when it comes
            to prototyping and designing projects, I often like to look back
            upon not only my previous experiences, but also the efforts of past
            researchers and engineers. Back in my high school robotics team, I
            would be the one members always throwing out outlandish ideas,
            hoping they stick. You can find such an example in our robot we
            designed for the 2015 season, where I proposed building an expanding
            robot that we called "Rex" (it looks like a T-Rex).

            Having a 53% Feeling rating was quite surprising as I think of
            myself as generally less emotionally aware than most. I would say I
            prefer using objective facts to make decisions (as an engineer), but
            after reading more about Thinking v.s. Feeling, I can't lie, it does
            make sense. When I thought about my past decisions more, I think
            about how often I choose to follow my gut feeling. As I have
            matured, I have found that the decisions I have to make usually have
            less and less "right answers". There's no objectively "best"
            decision. Take last summer for example, where I almost ran myself
            dry with commitments. Objectively speaking, I should not have tried
            piling so much on my plate, but my heart pushed me to explore new
            experiences and to not have any regrets. Or even riding roller
            coasters! When I was younger, I absolutely hated going to amusement
            parks (I'm looking at you Six Flags). Today though, I love roller
            coasters. Objectively speaking, there's no need to put my life at
            risk for a few minutes of thrill, but my heart pushes me to take
            risks. I do also try to consider other people around me. After a
            late night at Brody, I ran into a fellow CCSL Executive Board Member
            Elaine who said she was heading to FFU. Noting that she was going to
            walk alone and that it was nearly 10:00 PM, I decided to accompany
            Elaine to FFU to make sure she reached her destination safely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 53% Judging rating was also another surprising one. I initially
            thought I was more of a "free-flowing" planner described as the
            Prospecting trait. But when push comes to shove, I do much rather
            prefer to have a plan in mind. While I hate figuring out logistics,
            what I hate more is not knowing what the hell is going to happen. So
            even if I do procrastinate on planning events (trips, team meetings,
            schedules), I notice I do eventually draft up several plans. Just
            this past week when I visited my sister in San Francisco, while my
            dad wanted a "chill" trip with no set plan or schedules, I still
            found myself laying out what places we were all going to visit. I
            even laid out what times expected to be spent at each location.

            Now for Assertive v.s. Turbulent, I had a 64% rating for Assertive,
            which was my highest rating. Scrolling down the
            <a
              href="https://www.16personalities.com/articles/identity-assertive-vs-turbulent"
              >page explaning Assertive v.s. Turbulent</a
            >, I will say the quote "Assertive personality types learn lessons
            from their personal histories, but they see little purpose in
            entertaining the same regrets again and again" truly spoke to me. I
            learn from lessons in my past instead of trying to have repeats of
            mistakes. During my summer internship at a pharmaceutical company, I
            was assigned the responsibility of building a remote database
            application. And while I was excited to dive in and start coding, I
            quickly realized that I didn't fully understand the project
            requirements or the underlying technologies. Rather than admitting
            my lack of understanding and seeking help, I tried to power through
            and code my way to a solution. However, my code ended up being messy
            and buggy, and my team members had to spend extra time fixing my
            mistakes. To learn from my mistake, I realized that I needed to
            prioritize learning and understanding the project requirements and
            technologies before jumping into coding. I started asking questions
            and seeking help from more experienced team members, and I spent
            time researching and studying the underlying technologies. I now
            know to always understand the problem first before trying to
            implement a solution. The other qualities of being Assertive, such
            as being self-assured and even-tempered, is aligned with my optimism
            when faced with stress. I don't just focus on the goal, but also
            look to appreciate the journey and hope to grow whenever possible.

            Often in leadership positions, I don't really think of myself
            different from the other members. I rather approach it as if I am
            one of them, similar to how in Situational Leadership S3 leaders act
            in a supporting role. The leader often acts as an "equal" team
            member embedded within the team [1]. I appreciate this form because
            I really value giving other members platforms to share their ideas
            and express their opinions. But sometimes I find it hard to be
            aggressive or demanding of other members, especially when it comes
            to setting deadlines and making sure the team moves forward. I think
            the best example of this could be with my Clark Scholar Engineering
            Design class.

            <b>Some context:</b> This is a 1-credit class where we are currently
            looking to help fight the opioid crisis in Baltimore. We are looking
            to prototype a solution to increase access to harm-reduction
            resources (Naloxone, clean needles, counseling, etc.). Our group has
            been a part of this project starting in the Spring of 2022. The
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Issue:</b> Given that we are in a 1-credit class and as students
            balance 15+ credits from other classes, progress from this project
            has been a bit slow. While we are all motivated about the project,
            sometimes we just get overwhelmed with the other responsibilities in
            our lives and miss important project deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Immediate Improvements:</b> As a part of project management, I
            will look to implement a formal schedule with dependencies,
            deliverables, and phases. I met with Danica Mackesey, a project
            manager at Key Technologies to better understand the role, and
            learned that being in the position means constantly checking in on
            members and sometimes micromanaging. When I heard this, I
            immediately noted how it went against my mode of being "hands-off",
            but Danica stressed that project management involves finding a
            balance between being hands-off and micromanaging. While it is
            important to trust your team and give them autonomy, it is also
            crucial to monitor progress and ensure that everyone is on the same
            page. As a project manager, one must be able to identify when to
            step in and provide guidance or support, and when to step back and
            let the team take the lead.
            <br />
            <br />
            Having a formal schedule with dependencies, deliverables, and phases
            can help with this balancing act, as it provides a clear roadmap for
            the project and allows us to monitor progress and identify potential
            issues early on. However, it is also important to maintain open
            lines of communication with the team and encourage them to speak up
            if they need help or have concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Being Held Accountable:</b> Another team member Jillayne is a
            backup project manager on the team and will help to make sure I keep
            in communication with the team on deadlines and deliverables. I have
            promised to meet with every sub-team at least twice a week and
            Jillayne will follow up with me to make sure I have completed those
            meetings. Jillayne will also check to see that I have scheduled
            design reviews every three weeks with our community partners to make
            sure our team is getting feedback as needed during prototyping.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Intended Impact:</b> Having a clear schedule will hopefully help
            in the following ways.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <b>Provides clarity and direction:</b> A clear schedule gives team
              members a clear understanding of what is expected of them and
              when. This helps to reduce confusion and ambiguity and ensures
              that everyone is working towards the same goals. For example, with
              Evan and Bharath working on the backend and Mariah and Andrew
              working on the frontend, a schedule will help them see what the
              two interrelated subteams are working on. If Evan and Bharath are
              thinking of incorporating a new database, then Mariah and Andrew
              can simultaneously work on new frontend features to incorporate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Helps with planning and prioritization:</b> With a clear
              schedule, team members can better plan their work and prioritize
              their tasks. They can see how their work fits into the overall
              project and can adjust their priorities to ensure that they are
              meeting the project's deadlines and milestones.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Facilitates collaboration and communication:</b> A clear
              schedule can help facilitate collaboration and communication among
              team members. They can see how their work overlaps with others and
              can coordinate their efforts to avoid duplication or conflicts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b> Improves accountability:</b> A clear schedule helps to improve
              accountability by establishing clear expectations and deadlines.
              Team members are more likely to take responsibility for their work
              when they have clear goals and deadlines to meet.
