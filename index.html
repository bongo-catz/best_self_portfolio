            Hey everyone! I'm Jonathan, a third year undergraduate at Johns
            Hopkins University studying BME and CS. I hope to one day become a
            physician, but in the meantime I would recommend watching <a
            href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_by_the_Sea_(film)>Manchester
            By The Sea (fix this). Yes, I know it's a sad movie. I also love to
            hike in my free time! Hope to one day visit Patapsco Valley State
            Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm originally from Cerritos, CA (small suburb near Los Angeles),
            and I live with my older sister and father. My mother works
            full-time in China, so I see her whenever she comes back!
          </p>
          <p>
            On campus, I'm pretty heavily involved in Charm City Science League
            (CCSL), which is a club that mentors Baltimore City Public Schools
            in Science Olympiad. Academic wise, I'm really interested in the
            intersection of healthcare and engineering, whether that be
            designing microfluidic chips for diagnosing STDs or validating a
            virtual drilling simulator for surgical training. To escape from
            work though, I sometimes play pickup Basketball at the Recreation.
            If you didn't know, my jump shot created water.

          <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
          <h3 class="major">Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This blog was written in response to an assignment "Best Self
            Portfolio" from the Leadership Theory course (660.320) taught at
            Johns Hopkins University. In this assignment, we were tasked to
            include three sections, as outlined below.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Interviews</h3>
          <p>
            The pre-work for this assignment included interviewing two
            individuals close to us about a moment they remembered us as our
            "best moment". I decided to interview my high school and middle
            school biology teacher Mrs. Song and my girlfriend Wenyu to see how
            I might have changed as a person before or after I entered
            University. I summarize the discussions in the section under
            "Interviews".
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Self-Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            We were asked to take two self-assessments (listed and linked below)
            and reflect on the results of the two assessments. We were also
            asked to reflect upon a leadership concept we have covered in class
            and provide examples of when we have demonstrated this concept. I
            decided to focus on Transformational Leadership as that was a very
            recently covered concept! I summarize this reflection in the section
            "Self-Reflection".

            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3 class="major">Growth</h3>
          <p>
            To cap off this assignment, we were asked to identify an area of
            growth within ourselves, whether that be as leaders or as followers.
            And as a follow-up, to ensure we actually can implement this change,
            we were asked to identify a concrete way to grow and also how we
            envision our growth helping our teams. I summarize this process in
            the section under "Growth".
          </p>

          <h2 class="major">Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            I had the pleasure of interviewing two people about a time when I
            was at my best self. Wanting to see how I changed from high school
            to university, I decided to interview one person from before and
            another person from after I entered University.
          </p>
          <h3 class="major">Mrs. Song</h3>
          <span class="image main">
            <figure>
              <img src="images/song.jpg" alt="" />
              <figcaption>Our Team at Regionals</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </span>
          <p>
            <b>Name:</b> Mrs. Song <br />
            <b>Current Occupation:</b> Current High School Biology Teacher at
            Whitney High School <br />
            <b>Favorite Song:</b> "Can't Help Falling in Love" by Elvis Presley
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout my time in high school, I knew Mrs. Song well, having
            first met her in 7th grade. Physically, I didn't change much over
            the years, but Mrs. Song never failed to notice the personal growth
            I underwent. From a shy yet studious student who consistently aced
            Kahoot quizzes, I matured into a sociable and people-oriented
            leader. In my sophomore year, I became involved in Mrs. Song's
            effort to establish a Science Olympiad program in our school. For
            three years, we worked tirelessly to build and hone our team.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my senior year, Mrs. Song and I were determined to see our team
            advance to the States Competition. Unfortunately, on the day of the
            Regionals Competition, everything seemed to go wrong. Our bus
            arrived late, and then we were stuck in traffic. We even missed out
            on competing in two events. Despite the setbacks, I maintained a
            positive attitude and encouraged my teammates to keep going. I
            reminded them how much we had practiced together and tried to lift
            their spirits by emphasizing the importance of having fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            After six grueling hours of competition, we finally made it to the
            awards ceremony. As they announced the placements of the teams, I
            watched anxiously, hoping for the best. Though as 6th through 3rd
            place were announced, I saw Mrs. Song shaking her head in
            disappointment. But I refused to give up hope and exclaimed “Hey,
            there are still 2 places left.” And then it happened - our team was
            declared the second-place winner!
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Song recounted this story to share that I was at my best when I
            utilized my optimism to help push my teammates through the
            challenges, even when everything seemed to go wrong. A quote from
            Mrs. Song: "Jonathan, even I doubted our team's success, but you
            really showed the importance of never giving up and appreciating the
            journey."

          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to interview my now (and hopefully future) girlfriend
            Wenyu. I met her online during Zoom university in our first class
            BME Modeling & Design where we were on the same team. Let it be
            known here that she chased me 🙂, but jokes aside, Wenyu has really
            allowed me to experience college besides just hitting Brody on
            Friday nights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last summer, I decided to be foolishly ambitious. I took on a great
            deal of responsibility. While interning remotely at a pharmaceutical
            company, I also volunteered at Johns Hopkins Hospital, studied for
            the MCAT, and made time for my girlfriend. Yep, quite a busy plate.
            Despite feeling overwhelmed at times, Wenyu reported noticing some
            of my best moments during this period. I successfully managed my
            time to prioritize my tasks effectively. I always communicated with
            my internship manager and was able to develop a fully working
            database even though I never once touched SQL (a database management
            software) or backend work. And through the chaos, I also made sure
            to have fun and take breaks. I visited Towson and Federal Hill park
            for the first time. Surprisingly, I even learned how to cook,
            although initially I scared Wenyu with my knife skills and failed to
            make instant ramen by accidentally throwing away the salt packet.
          </p>
          <p>
            And from the 3 month period, Wenyu decided I was at my best was when
            I made her a birthday meal. Even though her birthday was two-weeks
            before my MCAT exam, I took the time to learn dishes from her
            family's province in China. I knew she had been craving her mother's
            cooking, and while I sure was not as well-versed, I wanted to repay
            Wenyu for her immense support. I made Fujian fried noodles following
